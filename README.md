# Visualization-of-Social-Media-Data-in-Tracking-Crime
This project aims  to facilitate law enforcement bodies in tracking crime data by classifying tweets and visualizing them on dashboard
We have proposed a system to classify the Twitter data into positive and negative sentiment tweets using deep learning
In the first part, we have explored several deep learning models to compare the result of sentiment analysis and implemented the model on the project
The Kaggle dataset has been used to train and test the model, which is subsequently larger than IEEE 
dataset
In the second part, we have used the computer visualization technique to shortlist the event from the challenge
We have developed several interactive graphs and dashboard systems to analyze the dataset in the project. For our research, we have taken IEEEâ€™s vast challenge dataset to validate the system, and the results we have achieved are encouraging. 
The IEEE challenge is a fictitious scenario where the challenge encourages finding the whereabouts of the displaced employees using Twitter data.
